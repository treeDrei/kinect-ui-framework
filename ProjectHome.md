This framework allows one to create user interface elements and decorate them with functionality.
Knowledge of the Kinect hardware and it's implementation is not required.
All one has to do is create a Kinect item(x,y, width and height) and register it to the framework. As long as it is enabled the user will be able to interact with it.
